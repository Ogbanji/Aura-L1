Architecture Overview

AURA-L1 is a modular, privacy-first Layer 1 blockchain designed for high-performance execution on Avalanche Subnets.

The architecture separates core concerns into distinct, interoperable components, allowing future upgrades or replacements without disrupting the overall protocol.

Core Components
	•	Runtime – executes transactions and smart contracts securely and efficiently
	•	Consensus – manages block proposal, validation, and finality using a modular PoS framework
	•	Crypto – handles cryptographic operations including signatures, hashing, and key management
	•	Mempool – organizes pending transactions and ensures efficient propagation to validators
	•	Governance – manages protocol parameters, upgrades, and emergency controls via on-chain DAO mechanisms
	•	CLI – provides a command-line interface for node operation, monitoring, and administration
