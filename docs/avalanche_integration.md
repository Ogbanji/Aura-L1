Avalanche Subnet Integration

AURA-L1 is designed to operate as a custom Virtual Machine (VM) within the Avalanche Subnet architecture, enabling high-performance, sovereign blockchain deployment.

The integration is modular, allowing future updates to VM logic or subnet configuration without impacting core protocol functionality.

⸻

Why Avalanche
	•	Subnet sovereignty – full control over chain parameters and validator selection
	•	High throughput – optimized for performance-intensive applications
	•	Fast finality – predictable block confirmation times
	•	Mature validator ecosystem – leverages established Avalanche infrastructure

⸻

VM Architecture

AURA-L1 provides a VM scaffold compatible with AvalancheGo, supporting:
	•	Custom state transition logic
	•	Custom consensus rules
	•	Native subnet deployment

This structure ensures interoperability with the broader Avalanche ecosystem while maintaining modularity.

⸻

Subnet Deployment Flow
	1.	Compile the AURA-L1 VM
	2.	Register the VM with the Avalanche network
	3.	Create a dedicated subnet
	4.	Launch validators
	5.	Activate on-chain governance

⸻

Validator Requirements
	•	Operate an Avalanche validator node
	•	Participate in the dedicated subnet
	•	Meet AURA-L1 staking requirements

⸻

Ecosystem Compatibility

AURA-L1 is designed to interoperate with:
	•	Other Avalanche subnets
	•	Cross-chain bridges
	•	Avalanche ecosystem tooling
