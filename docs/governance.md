# Governance Model

AURA-L1 is governed by its community through an on-chain DAO model.
All critical protocol parameters are controlled via governance.

## Governance Objectives
- Community ownership
- Transparent decision-making
- Safe protocol evolution

## Participants
- Validators
- Token holders
- Delegates

## Proposal Types
- Chain parameter updates
- Validator registration/removal
- Protocol upgrades
- Treasury decisions

## Voting Process
1. Proposal submission
2. Review period
3. Voting period
4. Execution upon approval

Votes are stake-weighted and recorded on-chain.

## Upgrade Safety
Protocol upgrades are:
- Time-delayed
- Fully auditable
- Reversible where possible

## Emergency Controls
Emergency parameters can be activated through supermajority
governance votes in case of critical failures.
