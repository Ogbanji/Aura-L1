# AURA-L1 Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for AURA-L1,
focusing on correctness, security, and sustainable growth.

The roadmap reflects realistic engineering milestones and
prioritizes production readiness over feature quantity.

---

## Phase 0 – Research & Design (Completed)
- Protocol architecture design
- Modular subsystem separation
- Avalanche Subnet compatibility planning
- Threat modeling for privacy components

---

## Phase 1 – Core Protocol Foundation
Status: In Progress

- Runtime execution engine
- Basic block and transaction model
- Encrypted mempool foundation
- Proof-of-Stake consensus skeleton
- Validator lifecycle management
- Minimal governance framework
- Developer CLI (local interaction)

Goal: Achieve a fully functional local network with deterministic behavior.

---

## Phase 2 – Privacy & Security Expansion
- Stealth address improvements
- Transaction encryption hardening
- Pluggable zero-knowledge proof interfaces
- Mempool privacy stress testing
- Slashing logic implementation

Goal: Strengthen privacy guarantees without sacrificing performance.

---

## Phase 3 – Governance Maturity
- Parameter voting finalization
- Upgrade proposal execution
- Treasury and funding controls
- Delegation mechanisms

Goal: Transition protocol control fully to the community.

---

## Phase 4 – Avalanche Subnet Deployment
- Avalanche VM stabilization
- Subnet creation and configuration
- Validator onboarding guides
- Monitoring and observability tools

Goal: Deploy AURA-L1 as a production-ready Avalanche Subnet.

---

## Phase 5 – Ecosystem & Tooling
- SDKs for developers
- Wallet and explorer integrations
- Cross-subnet interoperability
- Documentation expansion

Goal: Enable third-party developers to build on AURA-L1 easily.

---

## Long-Term Vision
- Community-owned infrastructure
- Privacy-preserving decentralized services
- Sustainable validator economics
- Interoperability within the Avalanche ecosystem

---

## Roadmap Governance
All roadmap changes are subject to on-chain governance
and may evolve based on community consensus.
